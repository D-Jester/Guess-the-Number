# Guess-the-Number

Its a file game....and is my first dynamic webpage. 
Game is simple 
1> You start the Game
2> You give a range to the computer from which computer can pick a random number for guessing.
3>You will guess and the computer will give you relative hints.

Basically, a practise and fun project.
